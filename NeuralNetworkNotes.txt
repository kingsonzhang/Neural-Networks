Chapter 2 Notes

Import MNIST is importing all of the handwritten digits
Shape: (60000 images, 28 pixels by 28 pixels)

Relu: Rectified Linear Unit
Sigmoid
softmax: probability distribution between 0-output size essentially

adam: Adpative Moment Estimation, essentially adaptive changes the gradient
sparse_categorical_crossentropy: Multiclassification
binary_crossentropy

Loss: Another name for cost function, lower the better, trending downward ideal

Broadcasting: Matching the shape of the matrices



Chapter 4 Notes
Accuracy: The higher the better
Validation Accuracy: Should stay about the same. If it trends lower or stabilizes, means it's overfitting

Multihot-Encode: Padding the data
